<p> I started getting into photography partially through high school. Since then, I have found photography to be a hobby that allows me to relax and push aside everything going on in my life to simply focus on something else. I am fortunate enough to have a high grade DSLR camera that I can use which is how I can create breath-taking images like the ones above. </p>
