	<h1>Dancing My Way Through Life</h1>
	<h2>A little about my dance experience</h2>

<ul>
	<li> Started at the age of 3</li>
	<li> Ballet, Tap (my favorite!), Jazz, Hip Hop, Modern, Lyrical, and Contemporary</li>
	<li> RMHS Orchesis Company member </li>
	<li> Student instructor and staff member at studio in Prospect Heights</li>
</ul>

<p> Dancing has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I started young and it carried me through high school and beyond. Although while being in college, I don't dance as often as I'd like, I work for the dance studio I danced at through high school. I student instruct and get to spend time helping the owner with administrative tasks when I go home. </p>

<p> My biggest piece of advice is that you don't have to dance competitively or with a company or studio to be able to enjoy dancing. Anyone can sign up for a class no matter their age. Dancing is a great way to express yourself with a community of fellow dancers around you. </p>
