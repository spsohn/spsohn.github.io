<h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
	<p>Hi! My name is Samantha Sohn and I am a junior at the University of Wisconsin Madison! I am studying Marketing and Digital Studies! I am from a Northwest Suburb of Chicago, but love the time I get to spend living in Madison, WI during the school year. </p> 
	<p>For my LIS 351 class, I decided to make a website about my three favorite hobbies/things I like to do for fun. These hobbies include photography, cooking/baking, and dancing. I'm going to provide some insight, tips and tricks related to each of my hobbies.</p> 

<h2>Overview of each hobby: </h2>
<ul>
<li>Photography- what I like to photograph and how I make the most out of a simple subject </li>
<li>Cooking/Baking - some of my go to recipes that everyone loves </li>
<li>Dancing - my dance journey and how you can start yours </li>
</ul>
