<p>All of my life, I've always enjoyed being in the kitchen cooking and baking with my family. We have many recipes that have been shared and passed down and that's something I really cherish. Some people are scared of cooking and baking, but if you stick with a certain recipe, you figure out what works for you and how to perfect it to your liking. </p>

<p> I found the pretzel recipe online and it's a great recipe to make with family and friends. I linked the recipe below if you want to check it out and try it yourself! </p>
